# RPi-WD-Packet-Interface
Interface to trigger radio transmit from Raspberry Pi via GPIO output with 10-second watchdog timer. Also includes ‘DCD’ status LED, triggered by a second GPIO output (supported in Dire Wolf v1.2).

The original version of this circuit was published in the Dire Wolf User Guide. The schematic was transferred into EAGLE CAD and board artwork was generated. 

Boards were created at OSH Park 

*link to OSH Park shared board removed. V1 was missing a bias resistor for the DCD LED and could potentially kill an RPi with excess current draw from the GPIO pin. New link will be added once a satisfactory board is complete and tested.
